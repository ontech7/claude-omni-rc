# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- **Readable tool calls.** Tool calls are described in words instead of raw
  JSON: an icon and name per tool (`📖 Read`, `⚡ Bash`, `🧩 Skill`,
  `🔌 MCP <server>`), the target (file, pattern, query, subagent type) in a
  `code` chip, the human `description` the CLI writes, and the Bash command on
  its own line. Absolute paths are shortened relative to the project (or to
  `~`); failed calls are marked `❌` with the first line of the error.
- **Extended markdown.** Replies render fenced code with the language hint,
  blockquotes, strikethrough, nested lists, horizontal rules and aligned
  tables; headings get a blank line before them so sections separate.
- **Tool-bubble hygiene.** Tool bubbles are silent (`disable_notification`) and
  preview-free, and at the end of a turn they collapse into a `▸ N steps`
  expandable blockquote. Split messages carry a `(i/n)` continuation marker;
  link previews are disabled on every streamed message.
- **Subagent cards.** In headless sessions each subagent's activity lives in
  its own `🤖 Agent` card — collapsed it shows the type, the task and its
  progress, `👁 Details` expands the tool calls, and it flips to `✅`/`❌`
  when done — instead of mixing into the main chat. Terminal sessions keep
  only the `🤖 Agent` line.
- **Behavior change:** the Ollama-based tool-call summarizer is removed. The
  CLI already writes a human `description` on Bash calls, so summarizing cost a
  local model call (with a 5s timeout per call) for a worse result.
- **`/context` command.** Shows the active session's context window used vs
  max: the used figure comes from the last assistant turn's token usage in the
  session transcript, the max from the Ollama model context (or a known
  Anthropic window). Works for headless and terminal sessions alike.
- **`/compact` command.** Compacts the active session's history from the
  phone: headless sessions get the CLI's `/compact` as a prompt, terminal ones
  pasted into the tmux pane. The session must be idle to compact.
- **Behavior change: unknown slash commands are no longer forwarded.** A
  `/something` the bot doesn't own used to be pasted verbatim into the active
  session; now it gets an "Unknown command" reply. Forwarding could leave a
  session stuck — Claude Code's own `/context`, for instance, is an interactive
  UI that blocks a turn while waiting for input.
- **Fix: tool calls stay grouped for the whole working stretch.** The burst
  window was 5 seconds, so a slow run — a model pausing between edits — showed
  one bubble per tool call. It is now 60s; the bubble is still bounded by the
  events that end a burst (separate text, prompt, permission, result, error).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-11

- **`/settings` command.** See and change the curated user settings from the
  phone: `/settings` lists them with their current value and where it comes
  from, `/settings <key> <value>` changes one (validated, with a readable
  error), `/settings reset <key>` puts a key back to its `.env` default.
  Changes are stored in `<STATE_DIR>/settings.json` with precedence over `.env`
  and apply at the next daemon restart. The curated keys cover the default
  model, the permission mode, the headless-session limit, the permission
  timeout, armed-on-start, the update check and the reasoning effort.
- **Reasoning effort per session.** Headless sessions now carry a reasoning
  effort: a new `DEFAULT_EFFORT` setting (default `medium`) plus a per-session
  `--effort <low|medium|high|xhigh>` flag on `/new`, passed to the model via
  the Agent SDK. Terminal sessions have it read from the running claude
  process (`--reasoning-effort`) when present.
- **`/diag` in the command menu and enriched.** `/diag` now appears in the
  Telegram command autocomplete and reports, per session, the model, the
  reasoning effort and the git branch when available (`—` when it can't tell).
  The branch is resolved live from the session's working directory, so a
  session that moved into a git worktree stays truthful.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-11

- **Structured log and `/diag`.** The daemon writes one JSON record per event to
  `~/.claude-omni-rc/logs/daemon.jsonl` (levels, size-based rotation). Every
  event bound for Telegram now carries an id from the transcript line to the
  delivered message, and an event that is *not* delivered is logged with the
  reason instead of vanishing. `/diag` reports daemon state, sessions, pending
  interactions and recent errors from the phone.
- **Delivery gate with a recorded reason.** Every event bound for Telegram goes
  through an explicit gate; a dropped event is logged with *why* (not the active
  session, injected echo, …) instead of silently vanishing. The eventId-to-outcome
  gap is closed for text-in-tool-bubble and question delivery, and the
  not-active-session gate runs before the injected-echo filter so a session
  switch can't leak events across sessions.
- **Multiple-choice questions arrive in time and answers drive the CLI menu.**
  `AskUserQuestion` is now emitted from the `PermissionRequest` hook — which
  fires *before* the CLI opens the menu — instead of the transcript, which only
  writes after the turn advances (i.e. after you already answered at the
  terminal). Answers are sent as a key sequence that drives the CLI's
  interactive menu one key at a time: pasting the option numbers corrupted the
  menu on CLI 2.1.227 and left the chat blocked. The hook and transcript copies
  are deduplicated (one-shot, age-bounded).
- **Transcript binding is pinned and non-destructive.** The transcript candidate
  is pinned at first sight, a rebinding never destroys the read state of the
  file it leaves behind, and a subagent transcript in the same project dir can't
  steal the watcher's binding — a session's stream can't be hijacked by a
  sibling process.
- **`/usage`**: 5h/weekly usage window for whichever provider is configured.
  Anthropic is read natively via the Agent SDK's experimental `/usage` control
  API; any other provider (Ollama, a custom proxy) shells out to
  [`ollama-usage`](https://github.com/ontech7/ollama-usage), which must be
  installed and authenticated on the daemon's machine.
- **`/usage` provider detection is model-aware.** The provider is decided from
  the active session's model (or `DEFAULT_MODEL`), matching `omni-rc`/headless
  sessions: an explicit `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (≠ Ollama) wins for every model; a
  `claude-*` model (or the `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`/`fable` aliases) means
  Anthropic; anything else is Ollama. Headless sessions with a `claude-*` model
  now route to Anthropic natively instead of Ollama.
- **The daemon finds `ollama-usage` (and `claude`) under launchd.** The launchd
  PATH didn't include `~/.local/bin`/`~/bin` (where uv/pipx install tools), so
  `/usage` reported "not installed" even when it was. The daemon now prepends
  those dirs to its PATH at startup, and the launchd plist template includes
  `~/.local/bin` explicitly. Terminal sessions also record their model (parsed
  from the `claude --model` command line) so `/usage` reflects the active
  session's provider.
- **Update check**: the daemon checks GitHub once a day for a newer release
  and, at most once per version, logs and sends a Telegram notice to the bound
  chat. Disable with `CLAUDE_OMNI_RC_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-07

### Hardening pass (breaking defaults)

- **Long replies no longer vanish.** Telegram rejects messages over 4096
  characters and the send was swallowed by a `.catch`, so a long answer never
  arrived. Text is now split into several messages at line boundaries, reopening
  any HTML tag left open across the cut.
- **Permission prompts no longer hang after a daemon restart.** The notification
  chat is persisted in `state.json`. When no chat is bound, the
  `PermissionRequest` hook gets no decision (native in-terminal prompt) instead
  of blocking the session for `PERMISSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and then denying.
- **Private chats only.** The bot refuses groups, supergroups and channels, and
  never binds one as a notification target — a group could otherwise receive the
  full session stream.
- **BREAKING: `/new` defaults to `--standard`.** Headless sessions ask before
  every tool call. Automode is now opt-in per session (`--auto`) or globally
  (`DEFAULT_PERMISSION_MODE=auto`). Sessions restored from an older `state.json`
  without an explicit mode also ask.
- **BREAKING: `/new` requires `WORKSPACE_DIRS`.** It no longer falls back to
  `$HOME`, which rooted an unattended agent at every file you own. The installer
  now asks for a project root.
- **`state.json` is written atomically** (temp file + rename). An unreadable
  state file is kept as `state.json.corrupt-<ts>` and reported, instead of being
  silently replaced by an empty one — losing sessions and authorized users.
- **Much lower idle CPU.** Overlapping polls are skipped, the process table is
  snapshotted once per poll instead of once per session, and a tracked session's
  real cwd is re-checked every `CWD_REFRESH_MS` (default 10s) rather than on
  every 500 ms poll.
- Added [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and a security section in the README, with
  the known limitations stated rather than omitted.
- Remaining Italian user-facing strings translated to English.
- **Multiple-choice questions no longer get stuck.** `AskUserQuestion` is now a
  proper flow: question sets are queued and shown one at a time, with
  single-select, multi-select (toggle + Done) and a free-text "Other" option.
  Answers are delivered per question to terminal sessions (option numbers) and
  as one message per set to headless sessions, so Claude continues after the
  last answer instead of leaving the input blocked.
- **Plan approval and model refusals no longer strand the session.**
  - **Plan approval** (`ExitPlanMode`, headless sessions) arrives as a 📋
    message with the plan text and ✓ Approve / ✗ Reject / ✏️ Edit buttons — Edit
    asks for the new plan text as a message, and the edited plan is sent back
    via `updatedInput`. Previously the plan was auto-approved in automode or
    shown as a raw permission JSON in standard mode, with no way to review or
    edit it. Terminal sessions still show the plan approval as a full-screen
    terminal UI the bot cannot drive — documented in the README.
  - **Model refusal** (`refusal_fallback_prompt`, the one `request_user_dialog`
    kind the CLI emits) offers 🔄 Retry / Skip, answered with the CLI's
    `retry_fallback` / `cancelled` result. Any unknown dialog kind is shown
    with a Cancel button instead of being ignored — an ignored dialog parks the
    turn and blocks the user. Unanswered dialogs time out into the CLI's
    default behavior, and `/stop`, `/delete` and `/rc off` cancel them.

- **Headless sessions are now provider-agnostic ("omni")** — the daemon spawns
  `claude` with the provider configured in `.env` (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` /
  `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), falling back to Ollama when
  unset. `/new --model <name>` picks the model per session. The `SessionStart`
  hook now registers every Claude Code session, whatever model backs it.
- **Renamed to `claude-omni-rc`** — the project is now positioned as remote
  control for *any* model that runs through the Claude Code CLI (Ollama-served
  models, other local or proxied LLMs, or Claude itself), not just Ollama.
  State dir default is now `~/.claude-omni-rc`, the launchd label is
  `com.ontech7.claude-omni-rc`, and the new `omni-rc` command starts a Claude
  Code session inside a `claude:<name>` tmux session ready for remote control.
  `/rc` with no argument now toggles the armed switch.
- **Stability hardening** —
  - **The daemon can no longer crash** — a global `bot.catch` (grammy no longer
    stops on a middleware error), a `safe()` wrapper on every handler, `track()`
    on fire-and-forget promises and an `unhandledRejection` guard mean one bad
    message (e.g. tmux down during injection) yields a friendly error, not a
    dead daemon.
  - **Timeouts everywhere** — Telegram API calls (35s), tmux commands (10s),
    file downloads (30s) and Ollama fetches (10s); the bot can no longer hang
    on a stuck network call.
  - **`/stop` reports the real outcome** — "Turn aborted" when a turn was
    running, the session's actual status otherwise; Ctrl+C to terminal panes is
    reported accurately.
  - **Multiple-choice questions show every option** — a numbered list of the
    full option text (with descriptions) in the message, plus tap buttons as a
    shortcut; nothing is truncated anymore.
  - **Markup is corrected, not dropped** — `mdToHtml` protects code blocks and
    balances tags, so malformed markdown can no longer make Telegram silently
    discard a message.
  - **History is capped by whole messages** — never cut mid-message; long
    messages are truncated at a word boundary with an explicit marker.
  - **The active session survives restarts** — `activeSessionId` is persisted
    in the state, so streaming resumes on the same session after a daemon
    restart.
- **Telegram UX fixes** —
  - **No echo of your own messages** — text the bot injects into a tmux
    session is not forwarded back from the transcript; messages typed at the
    terminal still stream.
  - **Multiple-choice questions as buttons** — `AskUserQuestion` is
    auto-allowed (no raw-JSON permission bubble) and appears with one inline
    button per option; tapping answers the session. Numbered replies still work.
  - **Claude slash commands** — `/`-commands the bot doesn't own (e.g.
    `/clear`, `/compact`, `/exit`, `/frontend-release`) are forwarded verbatim
    to the active session instead of being dropped.
  - **Interrupt** — `/stop` now sends `Ctrl+C` to the active terminal session's
    pane (like pressing ESC), and still aborts headless turns.
  - **Session history** — selecting a session shows its last messages; a new
    `/history [id]` command re-reads them on demand.
  - **Session delete** — new `/delete [id]` command and a 🗑 button per row in
    `/sessions`, with an inline confirm. Headless turns are stopped first;
    terminal panes are untracked, not killed.
  - **Approve/Reject feedback** — the permission message is edited in place
    (`✅ Approved` / `❌ Rejected`, buttons removed) instead of only a toast.
  - **Automode by default for `/new`** — headless sessions auto-approve every
    permission (no prompts); `/new --standard <text>` restores the approve/
    reject flow. The mode is per-session and persisted.
- **SessionStart hook + local API** — `./install.sh` adds a Claude Code
  `SessionStart` hook (`scripts/attach.sh`) that auto-attaches every session on
  start via a loopback HTTP API (`src/api.ts`, `API_PORT`, default 4123):
  project dir from cwd, tmux target auto-detected. The closest equivalent to
  Claude Code's native `/remote-control`. Idempotent; silent when the daemon is
  down.
- **Chat streaming for terminal sessions** — the active session's conversation
  is streamed as a chat by tailing the transcript Claude Code writes
  (`~/.claude/projects/…`): assistant messages rendered from markdown, your
  prompts echoed, tool calls grouped into one `🔧` notice per work burst (the
  first call creates the bubble, later ones update it). Notifications are
  event-driven: `❓` questions with the options (reply with the option number),
  permission buttons, and a `❌` on serious errors (e.g. `max_tokens`) — no
  status chatter while Claude works. `/view` still grabs the raw screen.
  History is never replayed.
- **Remote permissions for terminal sessions** — a `PermissionRequest` hook in
  `~/.claude/settings.json` delegates CLI permission decisions to Telegram
  (✓ Approve / ✗ Reject); it falls back to the native in-terminal prompt when
  the daemon is down or remote control is disarmed.
- **Session lifecycle** — sessions whose tmux target disappears are pruned from
  `/sessions`; a new status (`awaiting-input`) marks sessions that are waiting
  for you.
- **Tmux-only discovery** — only `claude:*` tmux sessions (plus hook / `/attach`
  ones) are tracked, registered with the pane's real cwd; no `~/.claude/projects`
  scanning, so non-Ollama sessions never appear.
- **Voice transcription removed** — text-only for now (whisper was removed
  from Ollama); transcription may return in the future.
- **`./install.sh --uninstall`** — removes the launchd agent and the
  SessionStart hook, and asks before removing the Ollama model and the state
  dir (`.env` is kept for a quick reinstall).
- **Bot in English** — all user-facing bot messages are now English (the bot
  was previously Italian).
- **Command menu** — `/rc`, `/sessions`, `/view`, `/new`, `/stop`, `/status`,
  `/attach`, `/help` registered via `setMyCommands`, so Telegram suggests them
  when you type `/`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-05

Initial release — Phase 1 MVP: local daemon + Telegram bot that mimics Claude
Code's `/remote-control` for Ollama-served models, without Anthropic
infrastructure.

- **Daemon** (Node 22 + tsx) with a typed internal event bus and a persistent
  registry (`~/.claude-omni-rc/state.json`) holding the global `armed` switch and
  the session list.
- **Headless sessions** driven via the Claude Agent SDK (`query` + `resume`,
  `canUseTool`), pinned at `0.3.221`; session ids persist across restarts.
- **Terminal sessions** discovered from tmux (`claude:*`), mirrored by
  capturing the pane, and driven 1:1 by pasting input + Enter, gated on the
  `armed` switch.
- **Remote permissions** — SDK `canUseTool` requests surface in Telegram as
  `✓ Approve` / `✗ Reject` buttons; unanswered requests time out into a deny
  (`PERMISSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`).
- **Media** — files saved to `~/.claude-omni-rc/inbox/` and forwarded as a path
  reference the model can read via its extra directories.
- **Security** — default-deny pairing (`ALLOWED_USER_IDS` or `PAIRING_CODE`);
  while disarmed the bot answers only `/rc`, `/help`, `/start`.
- **launchd agent** (`com.ontech7.claude-omni-rc`) with install script and template.
- **Guided installer** (`./install.sh`) that walks a non-expert through
  prerequisites, bot token, authorization, models and the daemon registration.
- **Docs & landing** — English README, `AI-GUIDE.md` (AI-agent setup matrix),
  landing page (`index.html`), CHANGELOG, MIT LICENSE, GitHub Pages `.nojekyll`
  and a CI workflow (`npm ci` → typecheck → vitest).
